      "AI: That's right! Kurt Cobain, the lead singer of Nirvana, had a few notable cars during his lifetime. One of them was a 1965 Ford Mustang, which was a classic and reflected his love for vintage styles. He also owned a 1993 Honda Civic, which was more practical and suited for everyday use. Additionally, there was a 1967 Dodge Dart that he was fond of. Cobain's car choices often reflected his laid-back personality and his preference for a more unassuming lifestyle, despite his massive fame. Do you have a favorite Nirvana song?\n",

He co-founded the band in 1987 with Krist Novoselic, and they later added drummer Dave Grohl. Cobain was not only known for his distinct voice and songwriting skills but also for his often introspective and sometimes dark lyrics.
